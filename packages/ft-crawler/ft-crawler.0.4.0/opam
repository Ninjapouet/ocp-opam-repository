description: """
The 'ft' tool is a multi-account terminal wallet for Free TON users and developers. It implements account creation/queries, contract deployments and calls, and inspection of blockchain state. It is the swissknife of Free TON.

The FreeTON blockchain is the open-source version of the Telegram Open
Network. FreeTON is one of the only blockchains with dynamic sharding
for unlimited scalability and immediate finality for real-time
applications. It also uses Proof-of-Stake with delegation through
smart contracts. Smart contracts are written in dialects of Solidity
and C++ with asynchonous external calls.
